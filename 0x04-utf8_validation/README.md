# UTF-8 validation

## Project objectives

### Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

1. Prototype: def validUTF8(data)

2. Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False

3. A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long.

4. The data set can contain multiple characters

5. The data will be represented by a list of integers

6. Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer    

```
